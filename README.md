## BPH_interactive_analysis
Porting typical BPH analysis cutflow to RDF for testing on highrate platforms.
This activity is framed in the Spoke 2 of the ICSC â€“ Italian Research Center on High Performance Computing, Big Data and Quantum Computing (https://www.supercomputing-icsc.it/en/), specifically under WP2, UC2.2.1


# Use case
The selected use-case is the analysis of Ds->phi(mumu)pi decays, that serve as control and normalisation channel for the tau->3mu search (PLB 853 (2024) 138633).

# The analysis plaftorms
The starting point is a prototypal CMS high throughput analysis platform, offloaded on local Tier-2: https://infn-cms-analysisfacility.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Within ICSC a new platform is being developed as documented here: https://icsc-spoke2-repo.github.io/HighRateAnalysis-WP5/sections/intro.html
